1,A Saint-Gobain employee is trying to implement a production planning system using Java. Which design pattern would be best suited for handling complex production planning scenarios?,MCQ,Factory Method Pattern,Observer Pattern,False,"['Factory Method Pattern', 'Observer Pattern', 'Strategy Pattern', 'Template Method Pattern']"
2,A Java program is using an ArrayList. What happens when the program tries to access an index that is equal to the size of the ArrayList?,MCQ,The program will throw a NullPointerException,B,False,"['The program will throw a NullPointerException', 'The program will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException', 'The program will continue to run without any issues', 'The program will enter an infinite loop']"
3,A Saint-Gobain factory uses Java to monitor and control the temperature of its furnaces. The code uses a thread to continuously check the temperature and sends an alert if it exceeds the safe limit. What synchronization mechanism is used by Java to prevent multiple threads from accessing the temperature sensor simultaneously?,MCQ,Java's built-in synchronization keyword,Java's built-in synchronization keyword,True,"[""Java's built-in synchronization keyword"", ""Java's volatile keyword"", 'ReentrantLock', 'Semaphore']"
4,"In a multithreaded environment, Java uses a synchronization mechanism to protect shared resources from data inconsistencies. Which of the following Java synchronization techniques is used to ensure that only one thread can access a particular resource at a time?",MCQ,Locks,Monitors,False,"['Locks', 'Atomic Variables', 'Wait-Notify mechanism', 'Monitors']"
5,"In a multi-threaded environment, what is the significance of the volatile keyword in Java?",MCQ,To improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of locks,B,False,"['To improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of locks', 'To ensure that changes made by one thread are visible to other threads', 'To prevent a thread from accessing a shared resource while another thread is modifying it', 'To make a method thread-safe by automatically synchronizing access to it']"
6,"In the context of Saint-Gobain's building materials business, what type of Java interface would you use to implement a class that can calculate the surface area of various shapes?",MCQ,Serializable,Comparable,False,"['Serializable', 'Comparable', 'Cloneable', 'Iterable']"
7,Saint-Gobain uses Java's multithreading features in its production management system to improve system responsiveness. What is the primary advantage of multithreading in this context?,MCQ,Improved system throughput,Enhanced system responsiveness,False,"['Improved system throughput', 'Reduced memory usage', 'Enhanced system responsiveness', 'Simplified system debugging']"
8,"In a Java application using Saint-Gobain's production management system, which design pattern would be best suited to manage the different production processes and workflows?",MCQ,Factory Method Pattern,Strategy Pattern,False,"['Factory Method Pattern', 'Observer Pattern', 'Strategy Pattern', 'Decorator Pattern']"
9,Which of the following Java collections is thread-safe?,MCQ,ArrayList,CopyOnWriteArrayList,False,"['ArrayList', 'Vector', 'LinkedList', 'CopyOnWriteArrayList']"
10,"In Java, what is the purpose of synchronizing a block of code using the 'synchronized' keyword?",MCQ,To increase the execution speed of the code,To prevent other threads from accessing the shared resource,False,"['To increase the execution speed of the code', 'To prevent other threads from accessing the shared resource', ""To decrease the system's memory usage"", ""To improve the code's readability""]"
